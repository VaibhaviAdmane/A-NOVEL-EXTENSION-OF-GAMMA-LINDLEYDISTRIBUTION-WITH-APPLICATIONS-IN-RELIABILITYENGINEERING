# A-NOVEL-EXTENSION-OF-GAMMA-LINDLEYDISTRIBUTION-WITH-APPLICATIONS-IN-RELIABILITYENGINEERING
Developed the Survival Weighted Gamma-Lindley (SWGaL) distribution, a new two-parameter lifetime model. Explored its analytical properties, derived survival and hazard functions, and estimated parameters using MLE. Applied the model to real reliability datasets, showing improved fit and flexibility.
